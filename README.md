# Python_For_DataScience

Academic Study Materials are prepared for MSc Data Science course in department of Futures Studies in University of Kerala.


We will be going through several Jupyter Notebooks during this time and use a number of data science libraries along the way. The easiest way to get started is to download Anaconda, which is free and open source. When you download this, it comes with the Jupyter Notebook IDE and many popular data science libraries, so you don’t have to install them one by one.

Here are the steps you’ll need to take before the start of the tutorial:

1. Download Anaconda
I highly recommend that you download the Python 3.7 version.

2. Download the Jupyter Notebooks

3. Launch Anaconda and Open a Jupyter Notebook

4. Install a Few Additional Packages
